# Horiseon Refactory Challenge

## Objective
To create an accesible/user friendly web page for Horiseon by refactoring their existing HTML code(improving it without changing what it does). I must improve on the code provided but can not change functionality. 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Refactoring Description
* Updated HTML Doc with semantic HTML elements
* Put code in order using HTML structure and added spacing w/comments
* Succesfully created Alt attributes in case of lag when loading web page
* Changed title to be more descriptive for the user to understand
